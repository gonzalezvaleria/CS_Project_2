	According to a <a href ="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3609433/">Swedish National Study</a> they talked to "137 199 sibling pairs & 7561 spousal pairs containing a proband with DA and matched control probands" and what they figured out was that if one sibling was addicted or took drugs and they had a younger sibling that was 2/3 years younger their sibling was(is) more likely to get addicted aswell verses if the sibling was 5-7 years younger. Again with the spouses they said "Spouses are correlated in the risk for substance use disorders.". They tested to see if the spouses shared like the same enviorment by seeing if after one spouse was regestered for DA if their spouse had a temporary spike in DA registration. Basically they wanted to see if after one spouse registered for DA and if they both shared the same enviorment did spouse #2 registered aswell.</h2></div>

Meaning any type of social promoting or showing drugs/drinks can be a reason, peer pressure is another reason, if they see other kids they know doing drugs and drinking they're going to want to do it too. Lastly simpling being around other drugs/drinks can be a main cause of teens/adults abusing drugs/drinks.</center></h2>
